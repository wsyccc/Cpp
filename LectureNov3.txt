Classes:
    standard member functions:
        constructor
        default constructor?   
        copy constructor
        move constructor
        copy assignment
        move assignment
    access specifier: public , protected, private
        class c{
            public:
                // interface for everyone
            protected:
                // interface for current class + its subclasses and their friends 
            private:
                // interface for current callsand its friends
         };
     
    Java         VS     C++ terminology
    Method       =      Member function
    superclass   =      base class
    subclass     =      derived class

    the implementation of a class can be in a separate file (in .cpp) from the class definition or it can be in the same file
    
    Class code: implement shapes // "probably will give us the code later" shapes.cpp
    
    Abstract Base Class (ABC)
     - A class with at least 1 pure virtual function
     - It cannot be instantiated
    
    Pure virtual function:
        virtual void f() = 0;
    virtual function:
        virtual void g();
