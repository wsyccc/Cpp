The output files were generated by the following commands (in Linux):

./a1 < in.1 > out.1
./a1 < in.2 > out.2
./a1 < in.3 > out.3
./a1 < in.4 > out.4
./a1 < in.5 > out.5
./a1 < in.6 > out.6
./a1 config2 < in2.1 > out2.1
./a1 config2 < in2.2 > out2.2

(a1 is the name of the program.)

The runtests script may be used to run the tests.  It assumes that the program
is named a1.

The files in the directory "invalid" are examples of invalid input.
The corresponding output files are "NON-STANDARD" as the format of error
messages has not been standardized. The output files were generated by 
commands like:

./a1 < inv1 > out.inv1 2>&1
